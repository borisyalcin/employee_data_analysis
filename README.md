## Introduction
In this project, we explore how to leverage SQL queries, Python scripts, and PgAdmin to analyze employee data. The dataset used for analysis may include information such as employee details, salary records, and department information.

## Setup
### Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/borisyalcin/employee_data_analysis.git
```
cd employee-data-analysis
Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python, PgAdmin, and necessary Python libraries installed:
bash
Copy code
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up your PostgreSQL database and import the employee dataset.

Configure the database connection in the Python scripts and SQL queries.

### Usage
Use SQL queries to perform basic data exploration and analysis on the employee dataset.
Run Python scripts to perform more advanced analysis, visualization, and generate reports.
Utilize PgAdmin for database management, querying, and visualization.
Technologies Used
SQL: Structured Query Language for database querying.
Python: A programming language for data analysis, scripting, and visualization.
PgAdmin: PostgreSQL administration and management tool.
